    "Summarization is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful for a consumer enterprise. For example, bots can be used to scrape articles, summarize them, and then you can use sentiment analysis to identify the sentiment about certain stocks. Who wants to read an article or a long email today anyway, when you can build a transformer to summarize text for you? Let's get started. By completing this assignment you will learn to:  \n",

    "- Implement DotProductAttention\n",
    "- Implement Causal Attention\n",
    "- Understand how attention works\n",
    "- Build the transformer model\n",
    "- Evaluate your model\n",
    "- Summarize an article\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can tell, this model is slightly different than the ones you have already implemented. This is heavily based on attention and does not rely on sequences, which allows for parallel computing."

When you were training sequential neural networks such as RNNs, you fed your inputs into the network in order. Information about the order of your data was automatically fed into your model. However, when you train a Transformer network using multi-head attention, you feed your data into the model all at once. While this dramatically reduces training time, there is no information about the order of your data. This is where positional encoding is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned how to implement the positional encoding in one of this week's labs. Here you will use the `positional_encoding` function to create positional encodings for your transformer. The function is already implemented for you."
